![Design](docs/Design.png)

> **Note:** To understand MQTT topic generation and its customization options please refer to the document [here](docs/AppSettings.md#Supported-Customizations).

## Features

1. Poll RESTful endpoints using ```GET``` verb.
2. Configurable polling interval for RESTful endpoints.
3. MQTT connectivity using anonymous, username/password or SAT token in Azure IoT Operations.

## Deploy in K8s

1. Add Helm Repo:

    ```helm repo add aio-extensions https://raw.githubusercontent.com/suneetnangia/http-mqtt-connector/release_management```

2. Copy configuration file from the example:
   1. For AIO [here](docs/AppSettings.md#Example-appsettings.json-for-AIO-MQTT-broker).
   2. For Non-AIO [here](docs/AppSettings.md#Example-appsettings.json-for-non-AIO-MQTT-broker).

3. Update configuration file with your specifics, refer to the guide [here](docs/AppSettings.md#Configuration%20Guide).

4. Install Helm package (appsettings.json content is stored as a K8s secret):
   1. For AIO:

        ```helm install http-mqtt-connector-01 aio-extensions/aio-http-mqtt-connector --namespace azure-iot-operations --create-namespace --set-file appsettingsContent=$pwd./<path to your>/appsettings.json```

   2. For non-AIO

        ```helm install http-mqtt-connector-01 aio-extensions/http-mqtt-connector --namespace azure-iot-operations --create-namespace --set-file appsettingsContent=$pwd./<path to your>/appsettings.json```

5. Uninstall Helm package (after evaluation):

    ```helm uninstall http-mqtt-connector-01 -n azure-iot-operations```
